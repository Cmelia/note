"""
You are given some text potentially including sensible words. You should count how many words are included in the given text. A word should be whole and may be a part of other word. Text letter case does not matter. Words are given in lowercase and don't repeat. If a word appears several times in the text, it should be counted only once.

For example, text - "How aresjfhdskfhskd you?", words - ("how", "are", "you", "hello"). The result will be 3.

Input: Two arguments. A text as a string (unicode for py2) and words as a set of strings (unicode for py2).

Output: The number of words in the text as an integer.

count_words("How aresjfhdskfhskd you?", {"how", "are", "you", "hello"}) == 3
count_words("Bananas, give me bananas!!!", {"banana", "bananas"}) == 2
count_words("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.",
            {"sum", "hamlet", "infinity", "anything"}) == 1
Precondition:
0 < len(text) ≤ 256
all(3 ≤ len(w) and w.islower() and w.isalpha for w in words)
